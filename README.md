### About
This is the BACKEND of a Web Development with a CRUD system for Users and Paycheck, allowing each user to List and Download its paycheck, and the admin to Upload and Register both users and paychecks.

### Instructions
Place on root folder and run

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now your server is listening http://localhost:3000/



### Database settings
You will find a file named recibos_app.sql. It has the SQL sentences for the MySQL schema.

### Login
There are two users:
user1 - nick: **empleado**
user2 - nick: **contador**

both of them with password: **toto**

User *contador* is the one who can upload paychecks and modify and add new people to the system.
User *empleado* just can modify the profile and download the paychecks.
